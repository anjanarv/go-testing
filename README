This example program is to cover everything on Go testing from a simple unit testing function to using more strategies
that can be used in Go testing. The repo includes different modes of Go testing - benchmark testing to check the performance of the code,
fuzz testing to identify the edge cases etc

- Test files names are of the format *_test.go
- To run the tests from command line use
  `go test`
  
If using Goland use the green arrows in the gutter to run individual tests or the green double triangle icon at the top in the gutter
